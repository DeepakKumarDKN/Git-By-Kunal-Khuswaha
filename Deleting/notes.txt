If i want to delete something from the project suppose deleteing a folder or deleting a file 
then i have to use a command called :

Note: 
-----
Remember one thing after performing each and every operation we have to repeat some steps like : 

    1. git add .                      |       "adding all the files"
    2. git commit -m "message"        |       "commit is must otherwise we wont be able to push"
    3. git push                       |       "then this is the last due to which everything will 
                                      |      be pushed into repositry whatever work we had performed"

These are the steps we always have to follow if we add something then also we have to follow these steps 
if we remove something then also we havr to follow these steps
