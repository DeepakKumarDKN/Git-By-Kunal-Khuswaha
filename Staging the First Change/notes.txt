Staging the first change: 
-------------------------

so we can see some untracked files but we have to add all of them into the Project folder: 

Lets say for an example we are working on a project and we have made some changes in the project for examplewe have added some code in a particular code file 

we can see those changfes we have made with the help of using the command git status

which will tell us that these are the changes have been made.

but if we have to add those changes in the project folder for that we have a command called

git add .

if we are using  [ . ] then it will select everything, otherwise instead of writting [ . ] we can also mention some specefic file name.

when we will use git add . it will keep all the files in the staging area

after using the command git ad . we can use the command git status  we can seee some green files that means those files are in the stage area remember previously it was red.
