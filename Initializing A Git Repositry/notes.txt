How To Store All Of Our History
-------------------------------
Suppose we are woking on a project and we need to do multiple things such as 
    1. Creating a file.
    2. Adding some code.
    3. Deleting some Files.
    4. Making some Changes.

soo all of this history are basicallly stored in another folder that git provide us is known as Git Repositry and it is named as: .git 
and we can get this folder by initializing and empty github repositry by writting: git init

D:\Git By Kunal Khuswaha>git init
Initialized empty Git repository in D:/Git By Kunal Khuswaha/.git/
-
initialized an empty github repositry inside inside the Git By Kunal Khuswaha folder
