Make the first change mean suppose i am doing any changes in 
Our Project for Example: 
    1. created a file 
    2. modified the file
    3. added a file 
    4. deleted a file 

but how do we come to know that yes some changes have been made .

so there is a command known as git status, see the changes i have made till now 
---------------------------------------------------------
D:\Git By Kunal Khuswaha>git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   README.md

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        Make The First Change/
----------------------------------------------------------

git status
-
so this is the command that basically tell us that these are the changes that have been made . and these are the changes that re not in the history of the project no one known about it.


Note: Now git will come to know if we are doing any changes since we have initialized and empty repositry
