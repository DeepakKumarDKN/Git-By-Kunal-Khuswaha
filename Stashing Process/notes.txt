Stashing Process 
-----------------

So previously we learn how to remove the commit and send them into unstage area by using the commit hash id, 
So after removing the commits i dont want to delete all of them i just want it to be on the stash area 
and i can call them whenever i want. 


For Example: 
-----------
let's say for an example i have to prepare a team of 5 players and i have already choosen my all 5 players 
but there are some players who are also good i want them to take into the team as well and there are  
two players which i want to take into the team but later not now so i will tell those players to go back and wait for my call 
whenever i will think that now you are required i will call you .

another Example:
---------------
Suppose i am working on a project and i am working on a particular feature and i want to try out something new with a clean 
code base all the i have made , all the modification are being made i want to remove those but also i dont want to save the process 
as a separate commit 

so i want to put all my work (meand all the changes i have made) without making a comiit and whenever i want that thung back 
i can get that back. so there is a command for that called git stash
